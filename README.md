# **printf-garden** - is a tutorial game for C language, where 'printf()' commands grow into a beautiful garden.
The player study format specifiyers ('%d', '%s', '%f', '%c' and others), growing flowers, trees, bushes, ponds and decorations, using proper printf() commands.

## Concept

Each format of 'printf()' - is a different type of plant or object, while each value is a variety or sort.

| Format |   Object       |              Comand example        |     Result      |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| '%d'   | Flower         |'printf("%d%d%d", 1, 2, 3);         |🌹🌷🌼           |
| '%c'   | Tree           |'printf("%c%c%c", 'A', 'B', 'C');   |🌳🌲🌴           |
| '%f'   | Water/islands  |'printf("%f%f%f", 0,5, 1,5, 0.9);   |🟦🟤🟪          | // the more value than deeper and higher
| '%s'   | Animals        |'printf("%s", 'hare');              |🐇               |

and so on.
In parallel we can make a concept of variables, to avoid values in a 'printf()' command.
Maybe add command 'scanf()' to realise some kind of orders to warehouse where items will be stored.
